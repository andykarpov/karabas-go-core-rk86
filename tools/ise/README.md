# Building the core with ISE 14.7

The core is built with Xilinx ISE 14.7 (XST) for the Spartan-6 XC6SLX25-FTG256-2, in a
Linux virtual machine with ISE installed (for example the AMD/Xilinx ISE 14.7 VM image).
One script builds one board from scratch in the working copy; `src/Makefile` runs the
steps (`make -C src <board>-xst`, ... run the build up to that step; the earlier steps that
are out of date run too):

```sh
bash tools/ise/guest/build.sh go      # or mini, minig
```

| Board | Configuration | Top | Constraints | Bitstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `go` | `src/radio86rk.prj` / `.xst` / `.ut` | `radio86rk` | `src/pins.ucf` | `src/radio86rk.bin` |
| `mini` | `src/radio86rk_mini.prj` / `.xst` / `.ut` | `radio86rk_mini` | `src/pins_mini.ucf` | `src/radio86rk_mini.bin` |
| `minig` | `src/radio86rk_minig.prj` / `.xst` / `.ut` | `radio86rk_minig` | `src/pins_minig.ucf` | `src/radio86rk_minig.bin` |

## Repositories side by side

Dependencies are referenced by relative paths and are expected next to this repository,
on the same level:

```
<parent>/
  karabas-go-core-rk86/   this repository
  karabas-go-tools/       make_core/make_core.py: packs the .bin files and the ROMs into src/radio86rk.kg
                          (src/make_core.py is a link to ../../karabas-go-tools/make_core/make_core.py)
```

The bitstream itself needs only this repository; `karabas-go-tools` is needed for the
`.kg` packaging.

## What a build does

1. `build.sh` removes `build/ise/<board>/` and runs `make <board>` in `src/`.
2. `regen_cores.sh` generates the Coregen cores of the `.prj`
   (`ipcore_dir/<path>/<core>.v` from `src/ipcore/<path>/<core>.xco`). The inputs of each
   core, `<core>.xco` and `coregen.cgp`, are tracked in `src/ipcore/`; the generated cores
   go to `src/ipcore_dir/` (ignored). COE files are referenced relative to the `.xco`
   (`src/roms/FONT.coe`, `src/rtl/osd/osd_font.coe`).
3. The Makefile copies the `.prj`, `.xst` and `.ut` to `build/ise/<board>/` with the paths
   seen from there and runs XST, NGDBuild, MAP, PAR, TRCE and BitGen with the options of
   the former ISE projects, so every output lands there and not next to the sources. The
   bitstream is copied to `src/<top>.bin`.

Logs are in `build/logs/<board>/` (`make.log`, `coregen/*.log`), the reports in
`build/ise/<board>/` (`make -C src <board>-report` prints the resources and the timing
result), temporary files in `build/tmp/`. All of `build/` is ignored. The log locations and
`build/tmp/` hold for `build.sh`; a direct `make` writes the Coregen logs to
`build/logs/coregen/` and prints the tool output to the terminal.

After a build `git status` is clean, unless the bitstream changed: `src/*.bin` are
tracked, and a changed `.bin` is committed together with the change that caused it.

## In the VM

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andykarpov/karabas-go-core-rk86
git clone https://github.com/andykarpov/karabas-go-tools      # only for the .kg packaging
cd karabas-go-core-rk86
bash tools/ise/guest/build.sh go
```

The Makefile sources `ISE_SETTINGS` (default `/opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/settings64.sh`)
before every tool, and `build.sh` passes it through; another installation is given with
`ISE_SETTINGS=<path>/settings64.sh`. A license accepted by MAP for `xc6slx25` is
needed: XST, Coregen and NGDBuild run without one, MAP stops with `ERROR:Security:9c` /
`ERROR:Map:258`. The license shipped in the AMD VM image is node-locked to the MAC address
of the first network adapter in the image's `.ovf`; an import that generates new MAC
addresses has to keep them (`VBoxManage import ... --options keepallmacs`) or the adapter
MAC has to be set back to the `.ovf` value.

## From a host checkout through a shared folder

The sources can stay on the host (for example Windows) and be built in the VM: share
the parent directory of the repositories with the VM, so that the side-by-side layout
is the same in the guest.

```sh
# host (VirtualBox): add the shared folder, or use Settings > Shared Folders
VBoxManage sharedfolder add <vm> --name projects --hostpath <parent> --automount

# guest, as root, when the folder is not mounted automatically
mkdir -p /media/sf_projects
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$(id -u ise),gid=$(getent group vboxsf | cut -d: -f3) projects /media/sf_projects

# guest, as the ISE user
cd /media/sf_projects/karabas-go-core-rk86
bash tools/ise/guest/build.sh go
```

- Call the scripts through `bash`: a shared folder has no executable bits.
- `.gitattributes` turns off line-ending conversion, so a Windows checkout has the same
  bytes as the repository whatever `core.autocrlf` is.
- A shared folder is slower than the guest disk: a build takes about 20 minutes on one
  virtual CPU.

## Changing the configuration

There is no ISE project file. The reports and the routed design (`.ncd`, for FPGA Editor
or PlanAhead) are in `build/ise/<board>/`.

- A source file: add or remove its line in the `.prj` of every board that uses it, in the
  order XST reads it (dependencies first).
- An XST or BitGen option: edit the `.xst` / `.ut`. MAP and PAR options: `MAP_OPT` /
  `PAR_OPT` in `src/Makefile`. A change of any of them is a new baseline, not a fix of a
  mismatch.
- A core: edit it in Coregen from `src/ipcore_dir/` and copy the changed `.xco` back to
  `src/ipcore/`, keeping the relative `coe_file` path. A new core is a new
  `verilog work "ipcore_dir/<path>/<core>.v"` line (its Verilog wrapper) in the `.prj`,
  through which `regen_cores.sh` finds the core, and, if it has a netlist in its own
  directory, an entry in `-sd` of the `.xst`.

## Reproducibility

Builds of the same commit with the same ISE 14.7 profile give the same bitstream, byte
for byte; the location of the checkout does not matter. The bitstreams built with the
Makefile are byte-identical to those of the former `.xise` projects and to the committed
release files. Reference SHA256 of the bitstreams of commit 10ff7fd:

| Board | SHA256 |
| --- | --- |
| Go | `119827fd3c602181cb5a0409c58baf153bd013d7668667a79e940989203e4af5` |
| Mini | `a7acac5902d299b65da8d800f8ea4c3b6fc9de58d094b4366da59c77e2f9d7cd` |
| Mini G | `9e839cfc955ee9d989e9fccad8275ecd25e695a125fca23ff7bf206565c238e2` |

A successful build and an unchanged bitstream show that the configuration was
preserved; they do not show that the core works on a board.
